        REACT HOOKS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
    
    1) What is react hooks?
          - hooks are functions that let you hook into the state of a react application 
            using functional components to manage state. componentDidMount() etc are no 
            longer necessary. ALmost anything can be done now by destructuring data and 
            using useState() and useEffect() hooks. Prior to hooks react was class based.

            Hooks relies on functional programming and closures in JS.

            useState() sets initial state
            
            useEffect()
