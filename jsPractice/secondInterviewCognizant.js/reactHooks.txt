        REACT HOOKS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
    
    1) What is react hooks?
          - hooks are functions that let you hook into the state of a react application 
            using functional components to manage state. componentDidMount() etc are no 
            longer necessary. ALmost anything can be done now by destructuring data and 
            using useState() and useEffect() hooks. Prior to hooks react was class based.

            Hooks relies on functional programming and closures in JS.

            useState() sets initial state
            
            useEffect() replaces getDerivedStateFromProps() componentDidUpdate() 
            componentDidMount() componentDidUnmount() etc.

            useMemo() replaces shouldComponentUpdate() which decided if you want to re-render
            this component
    
    2) Tell me the rules of react hooks?
         - only call hooks hooks at the top level
         - DONT call hooks from regular JS functions 
            instead => Call hooks from react function components 
                    or Call hooks from custom hooks

    3) How to debug hooks?
         - console.log(), browser inspector, debugger statements, 
           React Dev Tools for Chrome, useDebugValue()
