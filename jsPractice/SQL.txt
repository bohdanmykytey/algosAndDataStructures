    - Currently running PostgreSQL 12 on most enterprise apps from what I imagine, considering 
      that 13 is still in beta.
      
    - No need to learn new IDE!
        - By choosing PostgreSQL as the DBMS it's integrated GUI framework pgAdmin is maintained
          by the people who develop the data base language itself. It's available on Win, 
          Linux and MAC

    - Simple Local Setup and Config
        - Many traditional RDBMS's interact in preparatory ways with storage of a particular OS. 
          They require special kernel systems and variables in the local environment to interact
          properly with the OS. It's not efficient and time consuming.

          Instead, PostgreSQL by design interacts seamlessly with OS's and storage frameworks

    - Flexible Multi-Model Architecture
        - The Ingres research project that ended up being PostgreSQL was a pioneer of the 
          object-relational BMS or (ORDMBS - Object Relational Database Management System). In other 
          words, its a RDB that extends to support some object oriented programming features.

          Some of these OOP Features in the DB include 
            1) Extensibility of data types
            2) Access methods and functions
            3) Inherence of table properties and data types
            4) Polymorphism (with an operator) that would have different meaning w/in the same DB
            5) Encapsulation of tables
        
        - When storing and retrieving data in an ORDMBS, an Object Relational Mapping Tool (ORM)
          automatically translates between non-scalar Object values(attr and fields) && scalar 
          relational values (ints && strs organized within tables). 

        -Today all of the leading ORM tools support PostgreSQL.

    - PostgreSQL lends itself well to DevOps environments, start up is frictionless, it's completely open
      source (read: "free") even for enterprise implementation, 
     
      An added benefit is that PostgreSQL is readily available as a cloud service.
